# JavaScript: Lab

JavaScript is a popular programming language that is used to create interactive online applications. It is a scripting language that runs on the web browser's client side, allowing developers to create dynamic and responsive websites. This lab activity is divided into three levels: basic, intermediate, and advanced, with the goal of assisting developers in polishing their JavaScript programming skills. Developers can improve their JavaScript skills and create more robust and sophisticated web applications by routinely practising these activities. Continuous practice with exercises helps developers become more proficient in JavaScript and enables them to build more robust and sophisticated web applications.

## Lab

### JavaScript (Basic)
JavaScript is a versatile programming language used primarily for web development in building web applications. It provides the capability to implement dynamic features on web pages that cannot be achieved with HTML and CSS alone. As a client-side scripting language, JavaScript code is processed by the user's web browser rather than on the web server, allowing JavaScript functions to run after a webpage has loaded without the need to communicate with the server.

The lab comprises ten exercises related to JavaScript, covering a broad range of topics such as string manipulation, mathematical formulas, numbers, conditional statements, and loops. Each lab exercise includes a detailed description, a pictorial representation, and a flowchart to aid in completing the exercises. Additionally, an exercise lab is provided, which includes input values and outputs that must be produced.

To complete the exercises, you need to write the complete program code using JavaScript and save the files with a name based on the question number, such as "lab1js.html" for Lab 1. It is essential to include the name of the group member who completed the assignment in each file to avoid confusion during grading. By completing these exercises, you can enhance your programming skills and gain practical experience in implementing JavaScript functions in real-world scenarios.
