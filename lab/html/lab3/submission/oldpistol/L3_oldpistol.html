	<p>
		LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA has
		mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black highlighters.
	</p>

	<p>
		According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial passages"—are marred by
		an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting policy that
		began at the agency's inception in 1947.
	</p>

	<p>
		CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the
		particulars of several historic events, such as:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>the Cold War</li>
		<li>the civil-rights movement</li>
		<li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
	</ul>
