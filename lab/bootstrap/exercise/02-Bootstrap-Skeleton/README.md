# `02` Bootstrap Skeleton

If you want to import Bootstrap to your website, you can use this public URL that is available to everybody:

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.2/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" integrity="sha384-EVSTQN3/azprG1Anm3QDgpJLIm9Nao0Yz1ztcQTwFspd3yD65VohhpuuCOmLASjC" crossorigin="anonymous">
```


When using Bootstrap, you have to wrap all of your content within the following **container** classes:

```html
<div class="container"></div>
```
OR

```html
<div class="container-fluid"></div>
```


## 📝 Instructions:

1. Link the Bootstrap CSS Stylesheet with the document using the **link** tag you find above.

2. Wrap the content of the website within a `div` with a **container** class.

3. **Build** and then **Preview** the exercise and compare the differences.

4. Now change the class of the div you've just created to **container-fluid**.

5. **Build** and then **Preview** again and compare the differences.


## :mag_right: Important:

To understand the difference between both `container` classes, you have to make the `div` container smaller and bigger. There is margin-left auto and margin-right auto to center the container; whereas the content in the `container-fluid` class spans through all the page's width
