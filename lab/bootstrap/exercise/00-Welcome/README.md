# Welcome to Bootstrap Exercises!!

My name is [Alejandro Sanchez](https://twitter.com/alesanchezr). I'm really excited to have you here !! 🎉 😂 Learning to code is hard, you problably will need coaching! DM me on twitter if you have any question.

During this course you will be learning the following concepts:

2. Selecting HTML Elements from your website to apply the Bootstrap styles.

3. Apply Bootstrap classes to those elements.
