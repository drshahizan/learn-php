# Lab 4: Text To Speech Converter 

Text To Speech (TTS) is a technology that converts your text into speech sounds. You can convert your text into speech using different voices in this project (Text To Speech Converter App). If your text character length exceeds 80, a pause and resume option is also available.

In the JavaScript code, we must enter text and call the `textToSpeech ()` function, passing the user text as an argument. Within this function, use the window object's speech synthesis property to convert the entered text to speech. Speech Synthesis is a web API for controlling the speech service.

Then, using the `getVoices ()` method of Speech Synthesis, extract voices from the user device and insert them into the HTML select tag.
