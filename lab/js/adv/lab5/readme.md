# Lab 5: A Dictionary App

In this project, there is only a search input, and when you enter any existing word and press enter, a loading text of "Searching the meaning of..." is displayed.

If the searched word exists, the meaning, example, synonyms, and so on are displayed with a slide animation; otherwise, a message stating "Can't find the meaning of......" is displayed. There is also a pronunciation icon to help you pronounce the word you searched for.

This dictionary's implementation is as follows:

- First, get searched input, and then, using the fetch API method
- Send a get request to an API (dictionaryapi.dev) with the user searched word as a parameter.
- If the searched word exists, the API returns an object containing many details (definition, example, synonyms) about the word; otherwise, it returns the message "Can't find the definitions."
- After retrieving the data from the API, inserted it into a specific HTML element.
